" Note: This function is complementary with sexp#list_flow, which flows
" similarly, but stops only on list (non-leaf) elements.
" Selection Non Extension: See corresponding note in header of sexp#list_flow
" for the reason visual commands do not extend selection.
" Edge Cases:
" 1. The ambiguity that arises when an atom and list are separated by only
"    macro char(s) is solved differently by different lisp variants.
"    Example: foo'(bar)
"      Clojure: foo' (bar)
"      CL:      foo '(bar)
"    Moreover, current_element_terminal() is inconsistent, giving an answer
"    that depends on the starting position. Though the edge case is legal
"    lisp, it's not lisp a sane programmer should be writing, so I'm not going
"    to add a lot of logic to try to handle it consistently.
"    TODO: Revisit if current_element_terminal is ever updated to handle this
"    edge case consistently.
" 2. When a character literal ends in a literal space (e.g., `#\ '), special
"    logic would be required to avoid skipping over the whitespace when
"    searching backward for element tail. Since sexp_move_to_prev_element_tail
"    map handles this case incorrectly (landing on the backslash rather than
"    the following space char), and `#\Space' is much more readable than
"    `#\ ', I really can't justify adding a lot of logic to handle it
"    correctly here.
"    TODO: Revisit if move_to_adjacent_element is ever updated to handle the
